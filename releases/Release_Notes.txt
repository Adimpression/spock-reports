1.2.6 - 2015 August 12

* #39 Added support for showing comment on Spock's @Ignore annotation to reports.
* #39 Added support for showing comment on Spock's @Issue annotation to reports.
* #36 Log much more information about config and errors (use the --info flag when running a build).
* Small bug fixes when logging errors.
* Try to create report dir more strongly if it does not already exist when writing the aggregated report
(related to parallel builds).
* Upgraded Gradle version used in the build to 2.2.
* Due to above - re-added transitive dependencies on Spock and Groovy as Gradle no longer supports
"provided" dependency hack. Users must exclude dependencies if they wish to use different versions and avoid conflicts.

1.2.5 - 2015 March 8

* #33 Support for Spock 1.0, but this version also works with Spock 0.7
* #27 Added new report creator - TemplateReportCreator

1.2.4 - 2015 February 14

* #18 Added character encoding for HTML reports
* Support for configuring some properties using environment variables
* Stopped using `println` in favour of using java.util.logging
* Added a Table Of Contents to HTML reports (can be turned off via config file)

1.2.3 - 2014 November 08

* #15 Downgraded minimum Groovy version required to 2.0.8 (benefits some Grails users).
* Ensured successRate in reports gets bounded between 0 and 100% (some test problems count both as failure and error).

1.2.2 - 2014 November 03

* #14 support for @Unroll-ing variables not only in Spec names, but also in block texts

1.2.1 - 2014 November 01

* #12 stopped throwing Exception when a Specification setup method fails

      (notably VerifyError on Java 1.7_67 and 1.8_11)

1.2 - 2014 August 03

* #4 Support for @Unroll. Each unrolled iteration now shown as individual spec and placeholders are correctly resolved.
     Statistics also respect @Unroll semantics (each iteration failure is treated as a spec failure).
* #5 numbers shown in reports are internationalized
* #6 default config properties are merged with custom config (not replaced by it)
* #7 new config option to hide empty blocks (which do not have a description)

1.1 - 2013 Sep 14

* Added "when" and "who" ran tests to HTML reports
* Fixed bug with showing text for WHERE blocks in HTML reports
